# Elden Caw

This project is a rudimentary Twitter clone with a small twist: messages must conform to Elden Ring constraints. A **souls-like-twitter-lite** if you will.

This is a [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/) project bootstrapped with `create-t3-app`, so go check them out!

To run locally, install dependencies:

```
npm install
```

Sync Prisma to the database:

```
npx prisma db push
```

Run dev server:

```
npm run dev
```
